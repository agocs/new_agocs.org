I gave a talk last night to the ChicaGoLang meetup entitled "Message Queues and Go." It went over using a Message Queue Broker as a backbone to tie together a service oriented archetecture, with examples in Go. 

I put my slides here:

and you can follow along with the video here:

The examples in the code will, unfortunately, not work because they rely on RabbitMQ running on a specific IP address / port. 

Let me know if there's anything I got wrong or missed!
