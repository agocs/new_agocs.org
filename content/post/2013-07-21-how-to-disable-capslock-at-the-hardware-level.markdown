I hate capslock. It's a horrible, horrible key, and it gets even more in the way on my split ergonomic keyboards at work. I've tried registry hacks to kill it, but they don't seem to work. Here's how I deal with capslock:



	
  1. Obtain a small, flat-headed screwdriver. Insert it beneath the Capslock key.

  2. Pry downward.

If you ever need capslock later, just use a pen to poke the little capacitive sensor. I put the key into a drawer in case I ever need to reassemble the keyboard later.
