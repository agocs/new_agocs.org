# Today's flight

I got up at 5:30 so I could make it to the airport by 8:00. The guy who owns 
the flight school scheduled my lesson super early so he could fit people in 
before the presidential TFR that was supposed to go into effect at 15:45. I went
through the preflight checks as normal and everything seemed okay until I sumped
the fuel selector drain valve. Fuel wouldn't flow from that valve. I showed
my instructor who showed the owner of the flight school, so we decided to 
cancel the flight and do some ground work instead.

# Today's ground work

I'll go ahead and transcribe my notes.

- System and Equipment Malfunctions

- Emergency Descents
  - Engine fire
    - Engine out
    - Pitch for 100 kias

  - Need to descend quickly, e.g. to get below clouds
    - 45 degree bank
    - full flaps
    - pitch for 85

- FAR AIM
  - Two parts
    - Federal Aviation Regulations
    - Aeronautical Information Manual
  - FAR Part 61: Certification
  - FAR Part 91: General operating rules

- FAR 91.213 Minimum equipment for VFR Day flight
  - Mnemonic: ATOMATOFLAMES
  - Airspeed Indicator
  - Tachometer
  - Oil pressure gauge
  - Magnetic Compass
  - Altimeter
  - Temperature gauge for each liquid-cooled engine (n/a on a Cessna 172)
  - Oil temperature gauge
  - Fuel gauge
  - Landing gear position lights (n/a on Cessna 172)
  - Anti-collision lights
  - Manifold pressure gauge if constant speed propeller (n/a)
  - Emergency Locator Transmitter (if operating >50 miles from airport)
  - Seat belts

  - In addition, the POH specifies other minimum equipment

- Steep turns
  - 45 degrees (The attitude indicator doesn't have a mark at 45 degrees)
  - Pay attention to the sight picture when at 45 degree bank. Pick a rivet on
the cowling and use that to gauge bank angle
  - Need to be below Va
    - Va depends on plane's weight -- 95 if lightly loaded, 105 if heavily. 
Consult POH
  - Need to turn to heading +- 10 degrees
    - Begin roll out (1/2 bank angle) degrees before you achieve heading
    - e.g. if turning right at a 45 degree bank to 120 degrees, begin roll-out
22.5 degrees before 120 -- roughly 97 degrees
  - Need to maintain altitude +- 100 feet
  - Need to maintain airspeed +- 10 kts
    - High bank angle = decreased lift. Need to apply elevator up to maintain
altitude. Need to increase power to overcome drag.

- Foggles 
  - Climbing and descending turns

- Traffic pattern
  - AIM 4-3-3
  - Turn crosswind 300ft below pattern altitude
  - Downwind at roughly 2000 rpm
  - Once abeam numbers
    - 1500 RPM
    - 10 degrees flaps
    - Pitch for 80 kts. Aim for 500 fpm descent
  - When numbers are 45 degrees behind you, turn base
  - Base
    - 20 degrees flaps
    - 75 kts
  - Final
    - 60-65 kts
    - Full flaps when runway is made
  - Keep pattern turns no greater than 20 degrees of bank


- Landings
  - Airport
  - Airspeed
  - Centerline
  - I should have taken better notes here. No idea what my instructor meant

- Read up on ground reference maneuvers
  - Turns about a point
  - Turns across a road

- Review all emergency procedures

- Spin recovery
  - PARE
  - Power off
  - Ailerons neutral
  - Rudder in the opposite direction of the spin 
  - Elevator when you've stopped spinning to pull yourself out of the dive
