Sometimes, shit doesn't work out. For example: Mike's Hard Lemonade contacted me at the [Southside Hackerspace](http://sshchicago.org), wanting us to modify a golf cart as part of their "Mike's Hacks" summer ad campaign. I dumped a lot of time (and just a little money) into the project, but everything went south at the last minute. 

But this isn't about that.

At the same time, [Mason Donahue](http://www.pinterest.com/r4v5/) put me in touch with [Chicago Girls in Computing](https://www.facebook.com/ChicagoGirlsInComputing). I put together a lesson plan, put together Arduino kits, made a powerpoint, and taught a class. It went awesome.

I had them assemble and program basic nightlights (LEDs turn on when the ambient light drops). They took that idea and ran with it.

The kits:

- [Sainsmart Nano V3](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00761NDHI/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) -- $14
- [Half-size breadboard](https://www.adafruit.com/products/64) -- $5
- [Photoresistor](https://www.adafruit.com/products/161) -- $1
- 10Kohm resistor
- 9v battery
- 9v battery leads
- bunches of LEDs

The total cost per student came out to about $27. I was able to pick up a bunch of plastic containers from the grocery store for $0.10 each, and the kits fit into the containers.

They seemed to like it.

Major props go to Backstop, Stack Overflow, and DigitalOcean. I wrote them at the last minute saying it would sure be neat if I could give out some stickers at the workshop. Backstop gave me pads and pens, Stack Overflow sent stickers and markers, and DigitalOcean sent me a bunch of stickers (and chocolates).
