title: RadioShack is worth a damn again!
---

I remember a day before cell phones when you could go to RadioShack and get electronic components, Ham Radio gear, and a bunch of other really useful stuff. Times changed, and all they were good for was cell phones, overpriced batteries, and people yelling about the above. I've pretty much been ignoring Radio Shack for the past six or seven years.

I'd heard that things had changed. I walked into a RadioShack near me today, and walked out with an Arduino and a motion sensor.

What's my excuse going to be now?
