I saw a Kickstarter for a [cold brew coffee device](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bruer/cold-bruer-a-cold-brew-coffee-system?ref=recently_launched) today, and I started reading about it. Cold Brew is supposed to taste different from your traditional hot brews -- it gets less of the acidic flavors than traditionally brewed coffee, so you wind up with a smoother beverage. Also, cold brew techniques produce a coffee concentrate that you're supposed to dilute, and the idea of mixing up 50/50 cold brew and milk is interesting.

I had a Twitter exchange with my friend [Jordan Killpack](http://www.killpack.biz/resume.html) about cold brewin', and we determined that the Kickstarter device, while nicely engineered, was a little highfalutin. I decided to try my own cold brew using nothing but mason jars and coffee filters (and coffee, and water).


### Ingredients





	
  * Starbucks Blonde Roast, pre-ground (don't judge, it was on sale and all the good coffee places were closed at this point)

	
  * Two one-cup Mason jars with canning lids

	
  * Two standard paper coffee filters

	
  * Water


Going off of the [America's Test Kitchen recipe](http://www.americastestkitchenfeed.com/recipes/homemade-cold-brew-coffee/), I put 60g coffee in the mason jar and added 240g water. After a few minutes, I stirred. I'm going to let it sit until tomorrow night, and then I'll try it out.

On the right is coffee + water that's been sitting for about 10 minutes. I just finished stirring the one on the left.

On the right is the prototype for how I'm going to filter the coffee tomorrow. I'll just invert the assembly over a bowl or big cup and let it all drain. I'll update with how it worked out.
