In [this post](http://www.agocs.org/box-fan-beef-jerky-part-1/), I started making box fan beef jerky. If you can't remember where I was when I left off, go take a peek.

Okay, so. The meat sat in the marinade overnight, and come morning I loaded it onto a 20" by 20" HVAC filter, courtesy of The Home Depot.

The cats were very interested.

I assembled the filters and strapped them to the fan.

Here's what it looked like after a day at work:

Tasty, but not properly preserved. I cut up the pieces too thick, originally. The above picture is after re-cutting, and before re-drying overnight.

I don't have any pictures of the next morning, but the results are good. The jerky had a nice, mellow flavor, and has kept in a tupperware on the counter over the course of the week. Sabrina put the bug in my head to make Sriracha beef jerky... guess what I'm doing this weekend!
