- Write down your account number.
- Call Comcast: (1-800-934-6489)
- Sit through the phone tree. The correct options are:
	- 1: Yes, my phone number is the phone number associated with the account.
	- 5: Remove services
	- 3: Cancel all services
	- 2: No, please don't call me later.
- Get confused when your phone makes the hanging up noise.

Re-center your chakras and try again.

- Call Comcast.
- 1
- 5
- 3
- 2
- A guy answers after less than a minute of waiting! 
	- "Hi, my name is Chris, and I'd like to -"
	- "Hello, can you hear me? If you can hear me and I can't hear you, please call us back at..."

Okay, maybe that was a fluke. Let's try again.

- Call Comcast.
- 1, 5, 3, 2
- Another guy answers after a minute or two
	- I'd like to cancel
	- I'm moving, and Comcast doesn't service the new building
	- Okay, we'll go with "the new building provides Comcast already"
	- No, I don't want to add Comcast telephone service
	- Yes, I'd like to cancel
	- I'll drop off the equipment
	- Okay, thank you!

It took ten minutes from start to finish.
