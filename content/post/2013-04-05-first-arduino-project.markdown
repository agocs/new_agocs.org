title: First Arduino project
---

So, I know I'm way behind the curve on the Arduino. I got caught in a vicious cycle of, "Can I justify ordering an Arduino? No, I don't really have a project for it." "Should I start this project? No, I don't really have an Arduino."

Well all that changed, because I have an Arduino now (finally! Gosh!). I'd ordered a bag of resistors and LEDs on Amazon, and I have a passive IR motion sensor, so while watching Watership Down this evening I assembled my very first project.

It _lights up_ when it _detects motion! _(Also pictured: popcorn.) Earth-shattering, I know. But sometimes, it feels good to knock out a simple project. I haven't done microcontroller work for years, and it's fun!
