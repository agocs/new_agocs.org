I bought a Celestron FirstScope dobsinian telescope for a project that I've been kicking around. It's not super duper, but for $50, it's a functional telescope.

Before I bought it, I was looking for some dimension specs. Unable to find any, I decided to document it myself.

###First Impressions

It's not half bad. Pretty easy to use. Probably needs to be collimated, but it's definitely good enough for looking down on the city during the day. For $50, it's a solid scope. I'm impressed.


Here's a picture I took of a barge. It's a pretty hazy day today, unfortunately.
