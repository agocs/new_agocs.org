      <title>Using command line tools to analyze a crash</title>

&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&#34;https://nautiluslabs.co&#34;&gt;Nautilus Labs&lt;/a&gt;, we&amp;rsquo;re advancing the efficiency
of maritime transportation by collecting data and recognizing patterns. An
interesting side effect of this is that we have insight into a ships&amp;rsquo; actions,
not just day-by-day, but second-by-second. It&amp;rsquo;s not as simple as dots on a
map either; engine power, wind, rate-of-turn, it&amp;rsquo;s all important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We worked with one of our clients to take advantage of this recently. A few
days ago, one of their ships struck a jetty during a berthing maneuver.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I made an end-grain cutting board, and it&amp;rsquo;s about the coolest thing. It&amp;rsquo;s 1 &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;rdquo; thick and made from white maple. I&amp;rsquo;ll take you through the steps I followed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the first in what I hope may be a series of retrofuturistic pieces styled after 1950s era Popular Mechanics DIY home improvement articles. I hope it&amp;rsquo;s fun to read!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Jeep Box</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the problems with Jeep Wrangler ownership is there&amp;rsquo;s nowhere to store things out of sight. Your backpack, laptop, whatever, it&amp;rsquo;s all hangin&amp;rsquo; out there in the open. Even when you&amp;rsquo;ve zipped the top up, there&amp;rsquo;s nothing between your valuables and a set of sticky fingers besides a thin sheet of clear vinyl.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How I clean my boots</title>
      <link>https://agocs.org/2015/11/how-i-clean-my-boots/</link>

      <guid>https://agocs.org/2015/11/how-i-clean-my-boots/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I own a pair of Redwing leather boots. I really like these boots. They&amp;rsquo;re formal enough to be worn with dress clothes, but sturdy enough that I can grub around fixing cars and installing drywall. Good boots take care, especially to keep them waterproof and looking clean. This is what I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/Boots/i-tzM95Xg/A&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/Boots/i-tzM95Xg/0/L/20151112132901-XL.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Assigning Globals in Go</title>
      <link>https://agocs.org/2015/10/assigning-globals-in-go/</link>

      <guid>https://agocs.org/2015/10/assigning-globals-in-go/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This has bitten me in the butt a few times this week, so I figured I&amp;rsquo;d blog about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;be-careful-with-your-scope-when-you-re-assigning-values-to-global-variables-in-go&#34;&gt;Be careful with your scope when you&amp;rsquo;re assigning values to global variables in Go!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick little example. We have a globally scoped variable, &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt;. In our &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt;, we call &lt;code&gt;makeSomething()&lt;/code&gt;, which returns to us, we hope, a &lt;code&gt;something&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code&gt;nil&lt;/code&gt; error. Then we make that global &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; variable point to that variable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t work for &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.backstopsolutions.com/careers&#34;&gt;Backstop&lt;/a&gt; any more (but you should), but back when I did, we discovered we had no idea how long it took our users to load our tools. Hell, we couldn&amp;rsquo;t even figure out how many clicks per month we had! I was working with New Relic trying to get a quote from them, and the best I could do was 2 million plus or minus 800 thousand. We had insight into how long it took our servers to respond to requests, but no thought was given to DNS, loading outside resources, rendering DOM, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the hackerspaces at which I am a member installed a Beaglebone Black on their door and put a speaker outside.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://agocs.org/2015/03/sun-visor-bracket/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I shattered the sun visor bracket on my Jeep in the cold this winter, so I did the only sensible thing. I tried to machine a new one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started with a block of 2&amp;rdquo; by 4&amp;rdquo; aluminum stock. I cut 2&amp;rdquo; off of it with a band saw. The blade popped off of its guide with about &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;rdquo; left to go, so fixing that was a fun diversion.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://agocs.org/2014/12/message-queues-and-go/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I gave a talk last night to the ChicaGoLang meetup entitled &amp;ldquo;Message Queues and Go.&amp;rdquo; It went over using a Message Queue Broker as a backbone to tie together a service oriented archetecture, with examples in Go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I put my slides here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://go-talks.appspot.com/github.com/agocs/golangRabbitMQ/rmq.slide#1&#34;&gt;http://go-talks.appspot.com/github.com/agocs/golangRabbitMQ/rmq.slide#1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and you can follow along with the video here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;854&#34; height=&#34;510&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/-S0-qgl8120?list=UUoGyPn-NIuAgkhlN7NAMhqw&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The examples in the code will, unfortunately, not work because they rely on RabbitMQ running on a specific IP address / port.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me know if there&amp;rsquo;s anything I got wrong or missed!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Jeepquest is at an end!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you all so much for bearing with my inconsistently numbered posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, Sabrina and I drove up to Kenosha, WI to take a look at this 2002 Wrangler X. First, we had breakfast at a place called The Coffee Pot, where the only not-so-great thing was their coffee. Afterwards, we went to Dan Stipler&amp;rsquo;s Auto World.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I took a vacation day today and saw another Jeep!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/Jeepquest/i-GM5XjVz/A&#34; title=&#34;Photo &amp; Video Sharing by SmugMug&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/Jeepquest/i-GM5XjVz/0/M/20141118121516-M.jpg&#34; title=&#34;Photo &amp; Video Sharing by SmugMug&#34; alt=&#34;Photo &amp; Video Sharing by SmugMug&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was in a (blessedly indoor) used car lot way up on Pulaski and Addison. It took me, no joke, three busses and an hour and a half to get there. I walked past the place once, walked past it in the other direction, and then went into the wrong business where they were helpful enough to give me directions (turn right and go two doors down).&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We saw a Jeep today! The first we&amp;rsquo;ve seen as part of Jeep Quest. It was a 2000 Wrangler with 167,000 miles, owned by an older Russian man who was asking $6,500.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/Misc/i-JHrhXJ7/A&#34; title=&#34;Photo &amp; Video Sharing by SmugMug&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/Misc/i-JHrhXJ7/0/L/20141116122017-L.jpg&#34; title=&#34;Photo &amp; Video Sharing by SmugMug&#34; alt=&#34;Photo &amp; Video Sharing by SmugMug&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guy said it had a five inch lift of unknown origin, and that his son was going to take the hard top off and put a soft top on. He&amp;rsquo;d just replaced the cooling system and catalytic converter. There was some wacky bumper on the front. The body was in great condition, and there was very little rust on the frame. The interior was okay &amp;ndash; the son had fitted some ridiculous CD player with DVD nonsense, and there were a few stray wires poking out from under the dash. We took it on a test drive around the block. Sabrina commented that she had forgotten how bouncy Jeeps were, but she liked it overall.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When Sabrina and I moved to Chicago a year and a half ago, we sold both our cars. I&amp;rsquo;m not saying that was a mistake, but I have to spend an hour each way on public transit for both hackerspaces and the radio station, and the grocery delivery people always manage to surprise you. We decided we wanted a reliable vehicle to see us through the next few years here in the Second City. I, being me, want something fun and a little ridiculous. I managed to talk Sabrina into a TJ Wrangler.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At Backstop, we name releases after soups. In order for something to be considered a soup, you must be able to find a picture of it in a bowl on the Internet. According, therefore,  to the rules at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.backstopsolutions.com/careers&#34;&gt;Backstop Solutions Group&lt;/a&gt;, this constitutes An Ice Cold Glass of Surge soup:&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I went to the &lt;a href=&#34;http://sshchicago.org&#34;&gt;Southside Hackerspace&lt;/a&gt; this weekend to do some work on the telescope project. No major developments, but the following is worth pointing out:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Write down your account number.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Call Comcast: (1-800-934-6489)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sit through the phone tree. The correct options are:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1: Yes, my phone number is the phone number associated with the account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;5: Remove services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;3: Cancel all services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2: No, please don&amp;rsquo;t call me later.&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>###Corrections:
 4% != .004% : When I was writing the article, my brain translated 99996 into 96000. Big difference. It turns out that I&amp;rsquo;m unable to dequeue somewhere between .004% and .20% of messages in about half of test runs.  ###Note:
I&amp;rsquo;ve been chatting with some very helpful RabbitMQ-knowledgeable people, and they have some suggestions for the issues I&amp;rsquo;m seeing that I&amp;rsquo;m going to check out. I will update this article with my findings.</description>

      <description>Last night, I had a dream that I was telling a joke. It was a long one. I got almost all the way to the punchline before I woke up, and, thinking back on it, I had completely botched the setup. Shame on me.
Here&amp;rsquo;s the joke:
In eastern Europe, some time in the 15th century, there was a young rabbi. He was just out of training and was not ready to settle down, so he was wandering the countryside performing good deeds.</description>

      <description>Sometimes, shit doesn&amp;rsquo;t work out. For example: Mike&amp;rsquo;s Hard Lemonade contacted me at the Southside Hackerspace, wanting us to modify a golf cart as part of their &amp;ldquo;Mike&amp;rsquo;s Hacks&amp;rdquo; summer ad campaign. I dumped a lot of time (and just a little money) into the project, but everything went south at the last minute.
But this isn&amp;rsquo;t about that.
At the same time, Mason Donahue put me in touch with Chicago Girls in Computing.</description>

      <description>I know my site doesn&amp;rsquo;t exactly have any dedicated watchers, but if anyone noticed a period of downtime earlier this week, it&amp;rsquo;s because I was migrating from hosting on FatCow to hosting on a rented VPS through DigitalOcean. I also moved my domain registration from FatCow to Gandi.net. In this post, I plan to cover the hows, whys, and some lessons learned.
I&amp;rsquo;ll start with the juicy stuff.
Why? There are a couple of reasons, but the root of it all is that I got fed up with FatCow.</description>

I tried to keep the slides content-light, since I find that having too many things on the screen distracts from what I&amp;rsquo;m saying. I&amp;rsquo;ll recapitulate my notes below.

      <description>I saw a Kickstarter for a cold brew coffee device today, and I started reading about it. Cold Brew is supposed to taste different from your traditional hot brews &amp;ndash; it gets less of the acidic flavors than traditionally brewed coffee, so you wind up with a smoother beverage. Also, cold brew techniques produce a coffee concentrate that you&amp;rsquo;re supposed to dilute, and the idea of mixing up 50&amp;frasl;50 cold brew and milk is interesting.</description>

What Worked Trello Sabrina and I planned the move and tracked our tasks on Trello.com. I have to say, the ability to put together dynamic kanban-style task boards on the fly really helped us keep everything straight.</description>

      <description>I hate capslock. It&amp;rsquo;s a horrible, horrible key, and it gets even more in the way on my split ergonomic keyboards at work. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried registry hacks to kill it, but they don&amp;rsquo;t seem to work. Here&amp;rsquo;s how I deal with capslock:
 Obtain a small, flat-headed screwdriver. Insert it beneath the Capslock key. [  ](http://www.agocs.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/20130719_1104211.jpg)
 Pry downward.   If you ever need capslock later, just use a pen to poke the little capacitive sensor.</description>

      <description>Once every three seconds, that&amp;rsquo;s the magic number.
Some more interesting information: I pointed a Doubleclick click counter at a super-simple web service I wrote, running on a web server I rent, and I ran a test that follows the DLCK redirect. Here are the results:

I ran 300 clicks at 4s per click, then 500 clicks at 2s per click. As you can see, almost all of the first 300 clicks made it to the web service, but only around 380&amp;frasl;500 2s per click clicks made it.</description>

      <description>One of the projects I&amp;rsquo;m on seeks to proxy web beacons. Basically, I have a WSGI app that serves a 1x1 px gif, and then triggers a Celery app that goes out and actually &amp;ldquo;clicks&amp;rdquo; on the intended web beacon. During preliminary load testing with a Doubleclick beacon (actually a Doubleclick link counter), we discovered that requesting that beacon 1000 times in 5 minutes (one request ever 1&amp;frasl;3 second) only reported around 30 &amp;ldquo;clicks.</description>

      <description>It bothered me that the spices in the kitchen were out of order. So, I sorted them using my favorite sorting algorithm, Mergesort. My cats helped.

I started with an un-ordered list of spices.

Then I started to divide the list up into smaller lists. Panther helped.
31 elements became 15 and 16.
Then 7, 8, 8, 8.
Then 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4.
Then 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2</description>

      <description>In this post, I started making box fan beef jerky. If you can&amp;rsquo;t remember where I was when I left off, go take a peek.
Okay, so. The meat sat in the marinade overnight, and come morning I loaded it onto a 20&amp;rdquo; by 20&amp;rdquo; HVAC filter, courtesy of The Home Depot.

The cats were very interested.

I assembled the filters and strapped them to the fan.</description>

(What do I mean? Let&amp;rsquo;s say I want to pass a URL inside another URL as an argument. So, for example, I want to pass http://www.bar.com/?a=b&amp;amp;c=d _as a query string variable_ to foo.</description>

      <description>I realized this morning that I&amp;rsquo;m about six months late in changing my air conditioner filter. I was in Home Depot, and I thought, &amp;ldquo;You know what goes really well with air filters? Beef jerky!&amp;rdquo;
That&amp;rsquo;s right, I&amp;rsquo;m an unabashed Alton Brown fan. I saw this episode of Good Eats a few years ago, and I occasionally think, &amp;ldquo;Huh, I could do that.&amp;rdquo; Well, I bought three of the cheapest 20x20 filters and 1.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;d heard about making pizza in a cast iron skillet, and tonight, I thought, why not? I largely used this guy&amp;rsquo;s recipe (minus the part where he made his own dough and sauce. Maybe later.): http://www.macheesmo.com/2011/03/cast-iron-pizza/

      <description>I was working on a piece of code today, and I decided to refactor some of it. &amp;ldquo;This method is beginning to smell bad,&amp;rdquo; I thought. &amp;ldquo;I should break this series of if/thens off into a different method.&amp;rdquo;
One thing led to another, and soon enough I had some considerably better-structured, more readable code. But did it work? As luck would have it, this is the first project I&amp;rsquo;d gotten a chance to build from the ground up, and as such, the first project I&amp;rsquo;d been able to build with a whole stanking lot of test coverage.</description>

      <description>So, I know I&amp;rsquo;m way behind the curve on the Arduino. I got caught in a vicious cycle of, &amp;ldquo;Can I justify ordering an Arduino? No, I don&amp;rsquo;t really have a project for it.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Should I start this project? No, I don&amp;rsquo;t really have an Arduino.&amp;rdquo;
Well all that changed, because I have an Arduino now (finally! Gosh!). I&amp;rsquo;d ordered a bag of resistors and LEDs on Amazon, and I have a passive IR motion sensor, so while watching Watership Down this evening I assembled my very first project.</description>

      <description>I remember a day before cell phones when you could go to RadioShack and get electronic components, Ham Radio gear, and a bunch of other really useful stuff. Times changed, and all they were good for was cell phones, overpriced batteries, and people yelling about the above. I&amp;rsquo;ve pretty much been ignoring Radio Shack for the past six or seven years.
I&amp;rsquo;d heard that things had changed. I walked into a RadioShack near me today, and walked out with an Arduino and a motion sensor.</description>
