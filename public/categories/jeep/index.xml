      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the problems with Jeep Wrangler ownership is there&amp;rsquo;s nowhere to store things out of sight. Your backpack, laptop, whatever, it&amp;rsquo;s all hangin&amp;rsquo; out there in the open. Even when you&amp;rsquo;ve zipped the top up, there&amp;rsquo;s nothing between your valuables and a set of sticky fingers besides a thin sheet of clear vinyl.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sun Visor Bracket</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I shattered the sun visor bracket on my Jeep in the cold this winter, so I did the only sensible thing. I tried to machine a new one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started with a block of 2&amp;rdquo; by 4&amp;rdquo; aluminum stock. I cut 2&amp;rdquo; off of it with a band saw. The blade popped off of its guide with about &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;rdquo; left to go, so fixing that was a fun diversion.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Jeepquest is at an end!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you all so much for bearing with my inconsistently numbered posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, Sabrina and I drove up to Kenosha, WI to take a look at this 2002 Wrangler X. First, we had breakfast at a place called The Coffee Pot, where the only not-so-great thing was their coffee. Afterwards, we went to Dan Stipler&amp;rsquo;s Auto World.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I took a vacation day today and saw another Jeep!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/Jeepquest/i-GM5XjVz/A&#34; title=&#34;Photo &amp; Video Sharing by SmugMug&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/Jeepquest/i-GM5XjVz/0/M/20141118121516-M.jpg&#34; title=&#34;Photo &amp; Video Sharing by SmugMug&#34; alt=&#34;Photo &amp; Video Sharing by SmugMug&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was in a (blessedly indoor) used car lot way up on Pulaski and Addison. It took me, no joke, three busses and an hour and a half to get there. I walked past the place once, walked past it in the other direction, and then went into the wrong business where they were helpful enough to give me directions (turn right and go two doors down).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Jeep Quest part II</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We saw a Jeep today! The first we&amp;rsquo;ve seen as part of Jeep Quest. It was a 2000 Wrangler with 167,000 miles, owned by an older Russian man who was asking $6,500.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/Misc/i-JHrhXJ7/A&#34; title=&#34;Photo &amp; Video Sharing by SmugMug&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/Misc/i-JHrhXJ7/0/L/20141116122017-L.jpg&#34; title=&#34;Photo &amp; Video Sharing by SmugMug&#34; alt=&#34;Photo &amp; Video Sharing by SmugMug&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guy said it had a five inch lift of unknown origin, and that his son was going to take the hard top off and put a soft top on. He&amp;rsquo;d just replaced the cooling system and catalytic converter. There was some wacky bumper on the front. The body was in great condition, and there was very little rust on the frame. The interior was okay &amp;ndash; the son had fitted some ridiculous CD player with DVD nonsense, and there were a few stray wires poking out from under the dash. We took it on a test drive around the block. Sabrina commented that she had forgotten how bouncy Jeeps were, but she liked it overall.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Jeep-Quest Part 1</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When Sabrina and I moved to Chicago a year and a half ago, we sold both our cars. I&amp;rsquo;m not saying that was a mistake, but I have to spend an hour each way on public transit for both hackerspaces and the radio station, and the grocery delivery people always manage to surprise you. We decided we wanted a reliable vehicle to see us through the next few years here in the Second City. I, being me, want something fun and a little ridiculous. I managed to talk Sabrina into a TJ Wrangler.&lt;/p&gt;
