  <p>I was working on a piece of code today, and I decided to refactor some of it. &ldquo;This method is beginning to smell bad,&rdquo; I thought. &ldquo;I should break this series of if/thens off into a different method.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One thing led to another, and soon enough I had some considerably better-structured, more readable code. But did it <em>work?</em> As luck would have it, this is the first project I&rsquo;d gotten a chance to build from the ground up, and as such, the first project I&rsquo;d been able to build with a whole stanking lot of test coverage.</p>

<p>Well, I ran the tests. Bam! No, broken, syntax error, of course that variable doesn&rsquo;t exist, I got rid of it. Fix, fix, test again, and voila! Not only is my code cleaner and more readable, but I can objectively say it still does what it should do!</p>

<p>Thanks, TDD!</p>

<p><em>Update</em>: Thinking about it from the comfort of my own home, I realized an improvement i should have made. You know what? Test driven development will be there in the morning to help me not make a huge mess of things.</p>
