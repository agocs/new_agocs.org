Today, Sabrina and I drove up to Kenosha, WI to take a look at this 2002 Wrangler X. First, we had breakfast at a place called The Coffee Pot, where the only not-so-great thing was their coffee. Afterwards, we went to Dan Stipler&rsquo;s Auto World.

<p>Thank you all so much for bearing with my inconsistently numbered posts.</p>

<p>Today, Sabrina and I drove up to Kenosha, WI to take a look at this 2002 Wrangler X. First, we had breakfast at a place called The Coffee Pot, where the only not-so-great thing was their coffee. Afterwards, we went to Dan Stipler&rsquo;s Auto World.</p>

<p></p>

<p>This Wrangler looks almost bone stock. It has an aftermarket headunit and no rear seats, but beyond that, it&rsquo;s amazingly clean. What&rsquo;s better: no rust! According to the paperwork, this Jeep is from Arizona. The frame and suspension are utterly pristine.</p>

<p><a href="http://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/Jeepquest/i-BMb8gf4/A" title="Photo & Video Sharing by SmugMug"><img src="http://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/Jeepquest/i-BMb8gf4/0/M/20141129_133037-M.jpg" title="Photo & Video Sharing by SmugMug" alt="Photo & Video Sharing by SmugMug"></a></p>

<p>The salesman admitted he couldn&rsquo;t drive stick, so he asked me to pull it around. As cold as it&rsquo;s been, the Jeep needed a jump. It started right up once we did that, and Sabrina and I went for a test drive. We remarked on how smooth the engine felt relative to the other Jeep we&rsquo;d test driven together, how smooth the ride was once we got to the nicer roads, and how well it pulled.</p>

<p>The fuel light was on and we&rsquo;d been test driving for almost 20 minutes, so we stopped at a gas station to throw $5 worth of fuel in it. I got back in the Jeep to get back home, and it wouldn&rsquo;t start! I noticed a Toyota Landcruiser with bull bars and Star Wars vinyl decals on it, and I asked them if they&rsquo;d give me a jump. We get to talking, and they&rsquo;ve driven up from Florida. Sabrina and them talked about Tampa for a minute, then we got the Jeep started.</p>

<p><a href="http://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/Jeepquest/i-2LtX85D/A" title="Photo & Video Sharing by SmugMug"><img src="http://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/Jeepquest/i-2LtX85D/0/M/20141129_133017-M.jpg" title="Photo & Video Sharing by SmugMug" alt="Photo & Video Sharing by SmugMug"></a></p>

<p>We drove back to the dealership and talked about it. Sabrina liked this Jeep a lot, and we decided on some negotiating tactics. They were asking 10,955. I&rsquo;d point out the high mileage and lack of rear seat, and offer 8. Our highest was 9,500.</p>

<p><a href="http://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/Jeepquest/i-wkLtvhd/A" title="Photo & Video Sharing by SmugMug"><img src="http://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/Jeepquest/i-wkLtvhd/0/M/20141129_133043-M.jpg" title="Photo & Video Sharing by SmugMug" alt="Photo & Video Sharing by SmugMug"></a></p>

<p>I sat down with the salesman and we did just that (when I mentioned the missing seat, the salesman gave me a look that let me know I had him over a barrel a little bit). We agreed on a final price, and they wouldn&rsquo;t be replacing the rear seat. Sabrina got back on the road while I signed the paperwork.</p>

<p>On the way back, I stopped by Mars Cheese Castle!</p>

<p>A bonus that came with the Jeep: a CD labeled &ldquo;Vegas 2012&rdquo;. I listened to it for a while, seemed to mostly be West Coast rap I didn&rsquo;t recognize. I switched to NPR.</p>

<p>Success!</p>

<p>Stuff to get/replace:</p>

<ul>
<li>Rear seat</li>
<li>Windshield wipers are looking gnarly</li>
<li>One of the rubber windshield hood rests (ordered)</li>
<li>Head unit with a less ugly one</li>
<li>Locking underseat storage drawer</li>
<li>Spare tire is looking a little old and cracked, despite never having been used. The other tires are worn, but not egregiously so. They are M+S rated Firestone ATs. I&rsquo;ll replace all the tires in probably six months&rsquo; time.</li>
<li>Tow hooks</li>
<li>Grab handles</li>
<li>Side steps</li>
</ul>

<p>Stuff it could probably use:</p>

<ul>
<li>Oil change (Little darker than I&rsquo;d like)

<ul>
<li>Blackstone Labs analysis</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Coolant flush/fill (looked OK, do eventually)</li>
<li>Other fluids eventually</li>
</ul>
    </p>
