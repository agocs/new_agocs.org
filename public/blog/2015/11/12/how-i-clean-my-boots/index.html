      <p>I own a pair of Redwing leather boots. I really like these boots. They&rsquo;re formal enough to be worn with dress clothes, but sturdy enough that I can grub around fixing cars and installing drywall. Good boots take care, especially to keep them waterproof and looking clean. This is what I&rsquo;ve been doing.</p>

<p><a href="https://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/Boots/i-tzM95Xg/A"><img src="https://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/Boots/i-tzM95Xg/0/L/20151112132901-XL.jpg" alt=""></a></p>

<p></p>

<p>I start with some dirty boots. Look at that dirt!</p>

<p><a href="https://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/Boots/i-jjzVkjC/A"><img src="https://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/Boots/i-jjzVkjC/0/XL/20151112132910-XL.jpg" alt=""></a></p>

<p>We gotta get rid of all that dirt. I use an old microfiber towel. I normally wipe the dirt off every few days, but for a deep clean I&rsquo;ll remove the laces and really go at it.</p>

<p><a href="https://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/Boots/i-xLvtPHD/A"><img src="https://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/Boots/i-xLvtPHD/0/XL/20151112133247-XL.jpg" alt=""></a></p>

<p>It looks okay, but you can see the dust stuck in some of the natural wrinkles of the leather, as well as the boot&rsquo;s seams. To get that, I go at it with a stiff plastic brush.</p>

<p><a href="https://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/Boots/i-FF6vpn6/A"><img src="https://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/Boots/i-FF6vpn6/0/XL/20151112133545-XL.jpg" alt=""></a></p>

<p>I brush against the grain, sometimes stretching the boots to get into the wrinkles. I also brush inside all the seams, and around the base of the upper.</p>

<p><a href="https://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/Boots/i-dJLzTpg/A"><img src="https://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/Boots/i-dJLzTpg/0/XL/20151112134907-XL.jpg" alt=""></a></p>

<p>I follow up with Saddle Soap and a toothbrush. I put a sliver of saddle soap into an old coffee mug that&rsquo;s <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> full of hot water, stir that up well, and go to town. I get all the seams, re-touch all the wrinkles, and really scrub wherever I&rsquo;ve scuffed the leather. The saddle soap contains glycerin (so I&rsquo;m told) that helps to protect the leather. I scrub one shoe, then the other, then I rub them both dry with the same microfiber towel.</p>

<p><a href="https://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/Boots/i-znGdxFH/A"><img src="https://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/Boots/i-znGdxFH/0/XL/20151112140024-XL.jpg" alt=""></a></p>

<p>Dried on the left, still wet on the right. We&rsquo;re already doing pretty well, but we could do better.</p>

<p>I pre-heat the oven to 170 degrees (the lowest it will go), remove the top rack, and put aluminum foil on the bottom rack. I stick the shoes in the oven for 20 minutes or so. This dries the shoes out, gets them nice and warm, and opens up the pores in the leather. Then I rub the shoes with mink oil.</p>

<p><a href="https://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/Boots/i-Pnt7Knd/A"><img src="https://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/Boots/i-Pnt7Knd/0/XL/20151112143913-XL.jpg" alt=""></a></p>

<p>The mink oil makes the leather more supple, it hides scratches and scuffs, and it adds water resistance. I smear it on heavily, especially the scuffed areas on the toes. Those areas seem to drink up mink oil, so I add more and more until they stop.</p>

<p>The shoes go back in the oven for another few minutes to let the mink oil really soak in, then I pull them out and turn the oven off. I take a clean rag (or old tee shirt, or old sock) and buff the shoes to a medium luster.</p>

<p><a href="https://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/Boots/i-S8CFvkD/A"><img src="https://agocs.smugmug.com/Other/Boots/i-S8CFvkD/0/XL/20151112145809-XL.jpg" alt=""></a></p>

<p>Shoe polish? I don&rsquo;t use it on these shoes. I like the look of the natural leather, and I&rsquo;m going to keep caring for these boots in this way as they wear in.</p>
