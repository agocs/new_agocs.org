  <p>###Or, how we hacked reality</p>

<p>This is an eight-pin AGOX connector:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/NHrH5hOl.jpg"></p>

<p></p>

<p>In September of 2008, I was a student at the <a href="http://www.gatech.edu">North Avenue Trade School</a> and heavily involved in the <a href="http://www.wrek.org">WREK</a> radio station. One of my good friends at the time was <a href="http://centrisian.com/">Robert Wright</a>. My &ldquo;initials&rdquo; (how we logged in, signed up for shifts, etc.) at the radio station were &ldquo;AGOX&rdquo;, and I signed all my emails that way. One afternoon, Robert pointed me toward the Wikipedia Talk page for USB: specifically at a section called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:USB/Archive_4#Mystery_micro_plug">Mystery Micro Plug</a>. At the bottom, he wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Based on personal knowledge, and having worked in the field for a few years, the &lsquo;Mystery Plug&rsquo; is internally named the &lsquo;Agox connector&rsquo; when used in combination with digital cameras. We refer to them this way because of the gentleman with whom I worked. 128.61.120.190 (talk) 22:49, 23 September 2008 (UTC)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I thought it was funny, so I replied.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think I remember seeing it called the &lsquo;Agox Connector&rsquo; in Nikon documentation somewhere. I always wondered why. 128.61.69.123 (talk) 22:56, 23 September 2008 (UTC)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It would have died at this point if another Wikipedia editor hadn&rsquo;t gotten involved.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hmmm&hellip; very interesting. Do you have a reference for it anywhere??? ǝɹʎℲxoɯ (contrib) 06:33, 24 September 2008 (UTC)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well&hellip; One good lie begets another. Rob said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m no longer working there, but I could possibly try to get some documents from people who still work there. 128.61.120.190 (talk) 09:32, 24 September 2008 (UTC)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And then, a few days later, he said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So, after having asked around, I&rsquo;ve learned that the connector&rsquo;s internal name of &lsquo;Agox&rsquo; is on some documentation that we haven&rsquo;t released to the public yet. The name is perfectly fine to use for the article, but the Nikon documents cannot be released. If I could cite them here, I would, but alas, I am still bound not to release the information behind this. 24.98.65.137 (talk) 04:48, 30 September 2008 (UTC)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Finally, about a month later, I came up with the most ridiculous thing I could imagine.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It stands for Asynchronous Gamma-Object Transfer (x=trans). In Nikon&rsquo;s logical model, the alpha object acts as a server, the beta object acts as a client, and data that flows between the two are considered gamma objects. There are delta and epsilon objects as well, but those are too small to get into. 128.61.69.123 (talk) 23:27, 21 October 2008 (UTC)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We left it at that. A few months later, Rob pointed me back at the main USB article. I scrolled through and saw this:</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/usgXmpCl.png"></p>

<p>We&rsquo;d done it! Someone took our lies and made them reality! It didn&rsquo;t stop there. You could find Chinese companies selling AGOX cables and AGOX connectors, people mentioned AGOX connectors on forums, one guy even wrote a blog post about an AGOX to regular USB converter he made.</p>

<p>All good things must come to an end, and, rightly so, AGOX Connector got edited away. Wikipedia currently calls it a &ldquo;UC-E6 proprietary (non-USB) plug&rdquo;, but, in my heart of hearts, I know what it really is.</p>
